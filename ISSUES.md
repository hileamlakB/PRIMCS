# PRIMS Issues and Enhancement Requests

This document outlines the key issues and enhancements identified from the project roadmap. Each issue includes detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, and suggested implementation approaches.

## Performance Improvements

### Issue #1: Speed up venv creation, use cached venvs

**Priority:** High
**Labels:** `performance`, `enhancement`, `backend`

**Description:**
Currently, each `run_code` call creates a fresh virtual environment, which adds significant overhead to code execution. This affects user experience and server performance under load.

**Problem:**
- Virtual environment creation is slow (several seconds per execution)
- Repeated package installations waste time and resources
- No reuse of common environments or dependencies

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement a virtual environment cache system
- Pre-create common environments with popular packages
- Use environment fingerprinting based on required dependencies
- Implement LRU eviction for cache management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Virtual environment creation time reduced by at least 70%
- [ ] Cache hit rate of 60%+ for common dependency combinations
- [ ] Configurable cache size and eviction policies
- [ ] Cache persistence across server restarts
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics for cache performance

**Technical Notes:**
- Consider using `virtualenv` or `venv` with template environments
- Implement dependency hash-based cache keys
- Add cache warming for popular package combinations

### Issue #2: Harden CPU / Memory limits

**Priority:** High
**Labels:** `security`, `performance`, `sandbox`

**Description:**
The current implementation lacks proper resource limits, which could lead to resource exhaustion or abuse. Need to implement strict CPU and memory constraints for executed code.

**Problem:**
- No protection against infinite loops or CPU-intensive code
- Memory leaks or excessive memory usage can crash the server
- No per-session resource tracking

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement cgroups or similar resource limiting mechanisms
- Add configurable CPU time limits per execution
- Set memory limits per sandbox environment
- Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running code

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Configurable CPU time limits (default: 30 seconds)
- [ ] Configurable memory limits (default: 512MB)
- [ ] Graceful termination of processes exceeding limits
- [ ] Resource usage reporting in execution results
- [ ] Docker container resource limits integration

### Issue #5: OAuth 2.0 support for remote deployments

**Priority:** Low
**Labels:** `security`, `auth`, `integration`

**Description:**
For enterprise deployments, OAuth 2.0 integration would enable seamless integration with existing identity providers.

**Problem:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 client implementation
- [ ] Support for major OAuth providers
- [ ] User profile synchronization
- [ ] Group-based access controls
- [ ] Configuration management for multiple providers
- [ ] Fallback to local authentication

**Dependencies:**
- Requires completion of Issue #4 (Authentication framework)

## Infrastructure and Operations

### Issue #6: Artifact storage backend implementation

**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** `storage`, `infrastructure`, `backend`

**Description:**
Currently, artifact persistence relies on client-provided presigned URLs. Need to implement configurable storage backends for better control and usability.

**Problem:**
- Dependency on client-provided storage URLs
- No built-in storage management
- Limited artifact lifecycle management

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement pluggable storage backend system
